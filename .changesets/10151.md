- fix(setup realtime): remove "exp" from suggested setup command (#10151) by @jtoar

The realtime setup command was still suggesting running the experimental server file setup command if the server file wasn't setup. This fixes it so that it points users to the stable setup command, `yarn rw setup server-file`, instead.
