- fix(cli): avoid `npx` during upgrade command (#10479) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This change fixes a problem with the `yarn rw upgrade` command when you don't have `npx` installed. If you don't have `npx` installed you will now have to manually run a command to dedupe dependencies rather than this being done for you automatically during the upgrade command. If this is the case, the `npx` command will be logged to the console when you run `yarn rw upgrade`.
