- feat(baremetal): Add verbose output to ssh exec (#10525) by @Tobbe

Passing `--verbose` to the baremetal deploy command is supposed to give you
more detailed info about what's happening. Previously however passing
`--verbose` didn't actually provide any extra information. This PR adds logging
to the new SshExecutor class so that you can see exactly what SSH commands are
being run, and in what path.

Standard output (this stays the same before and after)

Doesn't really help much compared to the standard output ðŸ˜…
