- fix(esm): get lint working (#10152) by @jtoar

This PR fixes `yarn rw lint` and some generators and setup commands for ESM projects.
Before projects would get the following error:

```
Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.55.0

Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module ~/redwood-app/prettier.config.js from ~/redwood-app/node_modules/prettier/third-party.js not supported.
Instead change the require of prettier.config.js in ~/redwood-app/node_modules/prettier/third-party.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.
```
