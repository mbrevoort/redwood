- fix(cli): only show webpack options for dev if `bundler = "webpack"` (#10359) by @jtoar

  A few flags for `yarn rw dev` don't apply to Vite but are shown nevertheless. One of them, `watchNodeModules`, is legacy at this point. It's only useful for testing out framework changes on a project using webpack. It makes the webpack dev server reload on changes to node_modules. The other, `forward` (aliased `fwd`) isn't fundamentally Webpack specific, but has been broken for quite a while because the fix is nontrivial. It seems better to hide these flags for now, otherwise we're just advertising broken or no-op behavior.
