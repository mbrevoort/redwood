- feat(upgrade): Use GitHub token if available when downloading patches (#10515) by @Tobbe

If a GitHub token is available in the environment we use that when fetching the
git tree from GitHub. That way we're less likely to be rate limited. For most
users the token shouldn't be needed. The free allowance/usage of the GitHub API
should be enough.

We support `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `REDWOOD_GITHUB_TOKEN` as the env var names
