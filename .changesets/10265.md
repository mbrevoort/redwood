- fix(cli): Update build and serve to handle the absence of the api side (#10265) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This change allows you to successfully build your app with `yarn rw build` even when you choose to totally delete you api side. Previously you would have seen errors related to both Prisma and GraphQL. It also improves the error messages produced by `yarn rw serve` in this case.
