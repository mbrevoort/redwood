- chore(dbAuth): restore behavior of checking whether a search query is present

Previously dbAuth would check whether or not query string variables were
present at all before invoking the proper function. During a refactor we
updated this code to assume a query would *always* be present. Which it would be
during normal browser behavior. But, we had a complaint from a user who relied
on this optional check in one of their tests. So we're restoring the optional
check here.
